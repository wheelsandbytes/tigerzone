* Your move must be received within 1 second
    * Where, orientation, and location of meeple if meeple placed
* Your move will be confirmed [sent to both players]
    * Valid
    * Invalid: illegal tile placement => forfeit
    * Invalid: illegal meeple placement => forfeit
    * Invalid: timeout => forfeit
* If a move caused a scoring event [sent to both players]
    * Score each player earned
